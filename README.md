### Hi there, I'm Ben 👋
<!--Learn more about me on my [personal website](https://bnpd.github.io/bnpd/).  -->
I'm a software developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark.

I just launched a **language learning game** aspiring to refresh the concept "choose your own adventure" books for the 21st century. As a learner, you shape the plot by your conversations with the (AI powered) game characters.
Check it out at **[langam.app](https://langam.app)**.

At daytime, I streamline and automate development work across 20+ banks' Salesforce environments and 100+ packages, while ensuring quality and safety come first when we develop new solutions. 
What I'm proud of:
· 𝗣𝗶𝗽𝗲𝗹𝗶𝗻𝗲 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Set up our CICD pipeline for automatic deployments, test reporting and code quality scanning.
· 𝗦𝗲𝘁 𝘂𝗽 𝗖𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗤𝘂𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻: Introduced SonarQube and enforced our development guidelines with 30+ custom rules. Leading to 300+ fixed quality issues.
· 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗼𝗺𝗮𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝗹𝗼𝗴 𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗶𝘁𝗼𝗿𝗶𝗻𝗴: Increased compliance and observability using Kibana and Java Spring.
· 𝗦𝗮𝗹𝗲𝘀𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗰𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗲𝘀𝘀: Ensured smooth transitions by retiring/migrating deprecated features.

I'm always open to discuss cool ideas in AI, languages and automation!
