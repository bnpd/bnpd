### Hi there, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer based in Copenhagen, Denmark.  
  
I just launched a **language learning game** aspiring to refresh the concept "choose your own adventure" books for the 21st century. As a learner, you shape the plot by your conversations with the (AI powered) game characters. 
Check it out at **[langam.app](https://langam.app)**.  
Or, have a look at some of my **[other projects](https://bnpd.github.io/bnpd/)**.

At daytime, I streamline and automate development work across 20+ banks' Salesforce environments and 100+ packages, while ensuring quality and safety come first when we develop new solutions.  
What I'm proud of:  
- **Pipeline automation**: Set up our CICD pipeline for automatic deployments, test reporting and code quality scanning.  
- **Set up Code Quality Automation**: Introduced SonarQube and enforced our development guidelines with 30+ custom rules. Leading to 300+ fixed quality issues.  
- **Automated log archiving and monitoring**: Increased compliance and observability using Kibana and Java Spring.

I'm always open to discuss cool ideas in AI, languages and automation!
